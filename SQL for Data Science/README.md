# Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset
### Date: June 2022

### ðŸ“Š Description
In the [SQL for Data Science course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science) made by University of California, Davis and offered on Coursera, I analyzed a Yelp Dataset with the ER diagram below. In this project, I answered a series of questions to understand the various tables within this dataset. I also came up with my own inferences to determine the relationship between popular attributes of restaurants in Toronto, Canada and higher star counts.

### ðŸ““ Knowledge 
- Identify subset of data needed from a column or set of columns and wrote SQL queries to limit those results
- Use SQL commands to filter, sort, and summarize data
- Combine many analysis tables using the JOIN operator
