# Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset
### Date: June 2022

#### ðŸ“Š Description
In the [SQL for Data Science course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science) by UC Davis offered on Coursera, I analyzed a Yelp Dataset and answered a series of questions. In addition, I came up with my own inferences and analysis to determine the relationship between popular attributes of restaurants in Toronto, Canada and higher star counts.

#### ðŸ““ Knowledge 
- Identified subset of data needed from a column or set of columns and wrote SQL queries to limit those results
- Used SQL commands to filter, sort, and summarize data
- Combined many analysis tables using the JOIN operator
