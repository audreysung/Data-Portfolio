# Designing a Visualization for My Manager
### Date: June 2022

### üìä Description
In the [Data Visualization with Tableau Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-visualization) made by University of California, Davis and offered on Coursera, I used Tableau to design a visualization to answer specific business questions for a superstore company. 

### üè¨ Scenario
The [Sales - Superstore dataset](https://github.com/audreysung/Data-Portfolio/blob/main/Essential%20Design%20Principles%20for%20Tableau/Sales%20Superstore%20Dataset.xlsx) contains detailed information about my company‚Äôs sales. My manager, Sylvia, has made a decision to cut the three worst performing sub-categories in their region in terms of Sales. To do this, she has asked me to create one data visualization that will identify which three sub-categories are the worst performers by region, and show how much worse they perform than other sub-categories. Sylvia will use this visualization to inform which product categories to cut, and in which regions.

### üìì Objectives 
- Show the worst performing sub-categories in each region
- Show how those worst performers compare to other sub-categories in that region
- Identify the three worst performing sub-categories overall
- Demonstrate proper use of design principles, specifically ‚Äúpop-out‚Äù or ‚Äúpre-attentive‚Äù attributes, Gestalt principles, cognitive load and clutter, and static or interactive format

### üìî Knowledge
- Examine average profit ratios as measure of performance for each sub-category
- Sort values and highlight three worst performing sub-cateogires in each region and overall by color
- Create interactive filter for region

### ‚ùì Questions 
1.  How does your visualization leverage at least one ‚Äúpop-out effect‚Äù or ‚Äúpre-attentive attribute?‚Äù Which one(s) was (were) chosen and why?
- I used color to  highlight the three worst performing sub-categories in each region and overall. By using bright red for the three worst performing sub-categories and light gray for the other sub-categories, I can drive my viewer‚Äôs attention to focus on the worst sub-categories.

2.  How does your visualization utilize at least one Gestalt principle? Which principle(s) is (are) being reflected, and how?
- My visualization utilized the proximity principle by placing region and sub-category close to each other to help viewers determine which sub-category belongs to which region. My visualization also utilized the similarity principle by using color to emphasize the three worst performing sub-categories.

3.  How does your design reflect an understanding of cognitive load and clutter?
- My design reflects an understanding of cognitive load and clutter by placing the values of profit ratios next to the bars and removing extraneous labels and axes. 

4.  Is your visualization static or interactive? Why did you choose that format?
- My visualization is interactive because I added a filter where one can choose certain regions. I chose this format because it would be easier to focus on the profit ratios for one region rather than seeing multiple regions at once.

5.  What need does this visualization address that words or numbers alone cannot fill?
- This visualization quickly identifies the worst performing sub-categories and shows how each sub-category compares to one another.
